Current score (sandbox.R) is 196.17231

To reproduce the score, get _train.csv_, _test.csv_, _sf_train.csv_ and _sf_test_.csv from _/Processed_.
Run _sandbox.R_, with your working directory set to where the above files are.
You'll need the caret package(and gbm, but caret takes care of that if need be).

It should be pretty easy to improve on this.

Wow, you're still reading. At the moment the data preprocessing is still done in C#.
Not ideal to say the least, we know - Python scripts are imminent, we promise.
